      <h2>Overview</h2>
      Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think
      about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what
      interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.

      <h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
      To rasterize triangles I basically followed the three line test from
      lecture. I first found the bounding box by finding the smallest and
      largest x and y, because everything outside of that won't be in the
      triangle. I then made sure it was in ccw order because otherwise the
      algorithm doesn't work. I found online that if you calculate the signed
      area and it's less than 0, it's cw. S So if it's that I just switched
      coord 2 and 3 to make it ccw. Finally I just followed the algorithm from
      class, iterating through the bounded box and used the inside line test on
      all three triangle vectors and the point to see if it was inside.
      <br />
      <br />
      My algorithm just checks every pixel in the bounding box so it is not
      worse than one that checks every pixel.

      <h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
      What I did was basically as the question suggested I sampled it into a
      larger sample_buffer. Then from this sample_buffer I averaged out the
      colors to get a new color which was then rendered in the frame buffer. I
      modified the sample_buffer to account for this by multiplying the size by
      the sample_rate. Basically for every pixel, for the sample_rate I just
      sampled that many points from the pixel and kind of like a higher
      resolution photo put it into the corresponding square. I calculated the
      sampling points using an equation which I believe matches the points from
      the lecture. Super sampling works to antialias because for example the
      image from the last problem, instead of just having no color in the
      middle, by sampling more points it's able to more accurately assess what's
      inside the triangle and the color will be lighter but connected which
      results in a higher quality image.

      <br />
      These results are observed because in the corners, very little of the
      pixel is within the triangle. The more you sample, the more likely you are
      to capture the tiny part of it within the triangle which leads to more
      color instead of no color. For example if only the bottom right quadrant
      is in the triangle, a 1 pixel sampling in the middlew won't catch it, but
      the 4, 9, and 16 will which result in color and less jaggies.

      <h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
      Barycentric Coordinates is basically a way to represent coordinates inside
      (or outside) a triangle based on some weights of the vertices. Each vertex
      has a certain percentage that it contributes to the point which makes it
      useful for interpolation because you can just assign values to the
      vertices and interpolate from there. For example in the triangle below,
      each of the vertices has a color (red, green, purple). Each point in the
      triangle can be thought of as a weighted average of those colors. The
      closer is it to a point the more weighted it is to that color (why the
      parts near the vertices are pretty much the color).

      <h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
      Pixel sampling is basically finding the color of a pixel in an image by
      taking from a texture. The issue is that sometimes the texture doesn't
      align exactly with an object (common in 3d stuff), so we have to do some
      interlopating of sorts. The two pixel sampling methods so far are nearest
      - in which the nearest texture pixel color is used for the pixel, and
      bilinear - in which the four nearest pixels are averaged to find the
      color. To implement this, I used barycentric coordinates, which are
      weighted averages. I calculated the barycentric coordinates and multiplied
      by the corner u, v (texture coordinates) to get the corresponding texture
      coordinate for the point we need. Then I used that texture coordinate to
      sample the texture, which I then used to set the pixel color depending on
      which psm was used.

      The difference is that there is more "in between" colors in the bilinear
      sampling which creates a smoother image. It is noticable in the 1 pixel
      sampling for example in the bottom the border line is more filled ni. You
      don't really notice a difference in 16 pixel. The reason for this is
      because bilinear and supersampling are both ways to antialiase so when you
      supersample at 16 pixel, it already serves to "reduce" most of the high
      frequencies so when you then bilinear the work is already done so there is
      little to no difference. On the other hand when you do one pixel sampling,
      there may still be high frequencies (big differences in colors), which
      bilinear sampling serves to reduce and smooth out which is why its more
      noticable.

      <h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
      Levels sampling is similar to pixel sampling but with mip map levels.
      Basically textures are reduced to half size over and over to represent
      further and further levels. These are determined by jacobians which
      basically determine how "fast" the pixels are changing which results in
      levels. This serves to create a more smoother image because lower quality
      textures are sampled for 'further' parts. For levels I basically
      calculated these using barycentric coordinates on x+1 and y+1 and used the
      vertice u, v values to calculate the u, v values and the jacobians
      respectively. Then I basically followed the formula from lecture. For
      linear level, I basically used the two mipmap levels closest (since it's
      usually a float by the formula), and then used interpolating to find a
      color for the pixel.

      <br />
      <br />

      supersampling has high time intensity and memory intensity because you're
      basically sampling the pixels * the ratio. For example if you do 9x super
      sampling you're basically doing the same work as sampling the image at 9
      times the size which is slow for large images as well as storing the
      larger image is memory intensive too. this should have the highest
      antialiasing power if you run with enough samples though because with more
      samples basically just copying the texture exactly.
      <br />
      <br />
      level sampling is also pretty memory intensive but less than supersampling
      because you need to store map levels for the texture (which half over and
      over) which can be a lot of memory. this is in the middle of antialiasing
      because it isn't as effective as supersampling but still effective and
      faster.
      <br />
      <br />
      point sampling is kind of in between the two. memory wise it's the lowest
      beacuse you don't need to store extra details. time wise it's about the
      same as level sampling because it's just running pulling nearby pixels to
      do math calcaultions and faster than supersampling. effectiveness wise
      bilinear is decently effective but not as effective as supersampling and
      level because distant textures can still have aliasing. bilinear without
      level sampling can also cause blur.
